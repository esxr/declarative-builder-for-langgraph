# LangGraph Builder (Work In Progress)

Build your langgraphs declaratively instead of imperatively (e.g. from a JSON file)

---

The relevant code is in `langgraph_from_json.py`

---

Ideal for:

- Tools trying to build low-code builders/managers for LangGraph.
- Tools trying to build graphs dynamically based on a usecase
  (much more)

Work in progress, feel free to PR and contribute
